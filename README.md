## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

I've never implemented drag and drop and the MDN documentation was really helpful. Especially on the FileReader API.

### Useful resources

- [MDN web docs](hhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_API/Using_files_from_web_applications) - This helped me with drag and drop feature.
